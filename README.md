# About
* What is this repo?
> This is a slightly modified fork which includes some extra features & memes added to my liking.
* How's this different from the main repo?
> Since the `list` module in the main repo doesn't have recursive search support, I integrated **SearchX-bot**'s search module into this. You can now search for files/folders in more than one drive.  
>**Note**: I did **not** integrate the main repo's **Shortener** feature, since I personally don't like shortened links in my search results.

# How to deploy?

* Clone this repository.
* Add a text file with the drive names & drive IDs separated by a space to the cloned folder.

Format:

```
drive_name drive_id
```

Example:

```
sample_drive 0ASbFU2s497sDUk1PVA
```

* Rename `file_name.txt` to `drive_folder`. (yes, without `.txt`)
* Visit the repo(s) below for further instructions.
